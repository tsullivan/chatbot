"In the great hall of the castle, there are beautiful open-air windows with warm, nice-smelling air drifting through. Sunlight is catching a few specks of dust floating in the air. Not that much though, because it's pretty clean in here. There's also a nice looking comfy bed in the middle of the great hall. Hey wait - isn't it night time? Where is that light coming from?
Type SLEEP to sleep on the comfy bed, LOOK to look closer at the open-air windows, or EXIT to leave the beautful great hall and the castle."

What kind of weird forces are around that would make the sun so bright at this time of night!?Oh, also you notice that each window has a little socket in one corner, and that looks like the handle you're carrying in your pocket would fit in it! What do you say, want to give it a whirl???"`;

"I guess you win becase With the windows closed and blocking out the the unusually bright outside night air, you rest your weary body on the comfy bed in the exquisitely decorated great hall, close your eyes and have a pleasant sleep. You dream pleasant dreams as your subconscious has been steeped from conscious knowledge that all the oddities you've encountered have been safely dealt with and you are out of harm's reach. Let's not think about what happens when you wake up. You deserve this rest so enjoy it completely. YOU WIN you got to fall asleep! Goodnight, sweet Tim! Bye! Turns: 10 Score: 105
That was fun, Tim!"

"The tiny village has a tiny hotel with tiny beds made for resting upon by tiny skeleton hands. It warms you heart to see, but it makes you no less tired and your warmed heart is at the same time shamed with the truthful knowledge that you can find no rest in this enjoyable place. The hotel roof has a weird looking pole that looks like a handle crank for a castle window. WEIRD, right? The hotel building has a strange type of flagpole on the roof that looks like it can be held in a normal human hand like your own. It's unnaturally cheery in this smelly old cave. Probably because of the tiny village of tiny dancing skeleton hands. So cute! So tiny! So skeleton handsy!
